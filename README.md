My solutions to Advent of Code 2024

## Introduction
As I've done the last almost ten years, I will attempt to solve some
of the challenges in [Advent of Code
2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). Focus this year will be on doing
it in Go. Though I will probably resolve to using Python. Hopefully
finally understand how string handling works in Python 3. We'll see.

The repo is public, but I doubt anybody will learn anything from my
code (besides what not to do). And contribute. It's nice to work in a
repo, and why not use Github? Maybe some AI will *learn* something.
